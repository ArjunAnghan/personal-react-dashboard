## Overview

The personal dashboard application built with React.js aims to provide users with a comprehensive view of their personal information, tasks, and current weather in their city. This project demonstrates proficiency in React fundamentals, state management, and interaction with external APIs. Users can access their personal information, manage their to-do list, and stay updated with real-time weather updates, all within a single dashboard interface.


## Updating Constants

To update the user profile information, modify the `Constant.jsx` file in the project directory. This file contains the following the arrays:

- education , workExp , projects

## Explanation  
-  *Responsive Design* : Implemented a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS to ensure optimal display across various devices, enhancing user accessibility and experience.
-  *Component-based Architecture* : Organized the application into modular components, promoting code reusability and maintainability while adhering to the principles of component-based design.
-  *State Management with React Hooks* : Employed React hooks such as useState and useEffect for efficient state management within components, facilitating seamless interaction and updates.
-  *API Integration for Real-time Data*: Integrated external APIs like the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input, enriching the application's functionality with dynamic content.
-  *Context API for State Management* : Utilized React's Context API to efficiently manage the state of the to-do list, ensuring centralized and streamlined data flow across components. This approach facilitated easy access and manipulation of state, promoting organized code structure and scalability.
